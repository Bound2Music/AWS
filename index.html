  <ul>
	<li>Built a custom PC and upgrade parts as needed.</li>
	<li>Programmed an applet using JavaFX in Eclipse (IDE) that allows for data to entered in textboxes and stored to a database. The data can then be exported as a text file which follows a certain template with identifiers for each row of data. The data mainly focused on the Customers, which had a parent customer and many different Bill To and Ship To sites. This project largely came to be because of the need of data conversion scripts needed to go from my companies legacy ERP to Sage X3.</li>

	<li>Programmed a web app in python using various libraries, including the OpenAI library, to take natural language and convert it to SQL. User inputs ("show me all records in "x" table), 
	then the request gets processed by the AI GPT 3.5 Turbo model and the data gets returned in table format within the web app. For the database I used SSMS (Microsoft SQL Server) and hosted it in Azure. The data gets populated in the backend by the same Java program mentioned previously. (https://ai-sqlproject1.streamlit.app)</li>
